# Titanic-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-in-Python
📝 Task Overview 

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset. The goal is to uncover insights from passenger data that influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic tragedy.

📁 Dataset

Source: Titanic Dataset – Kaggle

Contains demographic and travel data for passengers, including survival status, age, class, gender, and more.

🎯 Objectives

Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, convert data types.

Compute summary statistics and gain insights by grouping (e.g., survival by gender, class, age groups).

Visualize data patterns and correlations to understand what factors influenced survival.

🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas – for data manipulation

Seaborn / Matplotlib – for data visualization
