# Titanic-Dataset-Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-in-Python
📝 Task Overview 

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset. The goal is to uncover insights from passenger data that influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic tragedy.


📁 Dataset:

Source: Titanic Dataset – Kaggle

Contains demographic and travel data for passengers, including survival status, age, class, gender, and more.


🎯 Objectives:

Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, convert data types.

Compute summary statistics and gain insights by grouping (e.g., survival by gender, class, age groups).

Visualize data patterns and correlations to understand what factors influenced survival.


🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:

1.Python.

2.Pandas – for data manipulation.

3.Seaborn / Matplotlib – for data visualization.


📊 Key Analysis Performed:

1.Distribution of survival across: Gender, Passenger class, Age groups.

2.Missing value handling in: Age, Cabin, Embarked

3.Conversion of categorical data (Sex, Embarked) into numerical form for analysis

4.Correlation heatmap of numerical features

5.Bar plots and count plots for visualizing survival patterns


📈 Bonus Visualizations:

1.Bar plots: Survival rate by gender and class

2.Heatmap: Feature correlations including survival

3.Age distribution and survival density plots


💡 Skills Demonstrated:

1.Data wrangling with Pandas

2.Data visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib

3.Handling missing and categorical data

4.Deriving business/statistical insights from raw data
