## 📝 Task Overview 

This project presents an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the classic Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster dataset. The goal is to uncover insights from passenger data that influenced survival outcomes during the Titanic tragedy.

---

## 📁 Dataset:

- Source: Titanic Dataset – Kaggle

- Contains demographic and travel data for passengers, including survival status, age, class, gender, and more.

---

## 🎯 Objectives:

- Perform data cleaning: handle missing values, convert data types.

- Compute summary statistics and gain insights by grouping (e.g., survival by gender, class, age groups).

- Visualize data patterns and correlations to understand what factors influenced survival.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used:

- Python.

- Pandas – for data manipulation.

- Seaborn / Matplotlib – for data visualization.

---

## 📊 Key Analysis Performed:

- Distribution of survival across:
    - Gender.
    - Passenger class.
    - Age groups.

- Missing value handling in:
    - Age, Cabin, Embarked

- Conversion of categorical data (Sex, Embarked) into numerical form for analysis

- Correlation heatmap of numerical features

- Bar plots and count plots for visualizing survival patterns

---

## 📈 Bonus Visualizations:

- Bar plots: Survival rate by gender and class

- Heatmap: Feature correlations including survival

- Age distribution and survival density plots

---

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated:

- Data wrangling with Pandas

- Data visualization with Seaborn/Matplotlib

- Handling missing and categorical data

- Deriving business/statistical insights from raw data
